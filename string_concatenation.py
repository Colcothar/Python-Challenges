#I want you to help me make a string to use for an email greeting. 
#To start, we need a variable named name that's assigned to your name. Deja vu, huh?

name = 'Jason'

#Make a new variable named subject that concatenates (uses the + sign) the string "Treehouse loves" and your name variable.
#You've probably received an email or two with this subject already!

subject = "Treehouse loves " + name
