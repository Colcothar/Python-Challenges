#I want to make the email subject one more time, but this time let's use the .format() method for strings.
#Go ahead and make your name variable again. Hey, all practice is good practice, right?

name = "Jason"

#OK, now use .format() on the string "Treehouse loves {}" to put your name into the placeholder. 
#Assign this to the variable subject (so start with subject =).

subject = "Treehouse loves {}".format(name)
