# Let's calculate, with a bit of imprecision, how many days old you are.
# First, create a variable named years. Assign years to the number of years old you are. This should be an integer. 

years = 28

#Now we need to multiply the number years by the number of days in a year. 
#We'll ignore leap years, so just multiply years by 365 and assign it to the variable days.

days = years * 365

#Make a new variable named weeks. Give it the value of days divided by 7.

weeks = days / 7
